# HaringEscherCPsat

This is a modest project that uses Constraint Programming and some recursion to generate artistic images. They are inspired by the work of Keith Haring (for their aesthetics) and MC Escher (for their pattern structure). The goal is to create large interlocking patterns of organic shapes. But unlike in Escher's work, and more like in Haring's work, we don't want translational symmetry (or repetition).
